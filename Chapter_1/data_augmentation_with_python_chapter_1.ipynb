        "Data augmentation is essential for developing a successful Deep Learning (DL) project. However, data scientists and developers often overlook this crucial step. It is not a secret that you will spend the majority of the project time gathering, cleaning, and augmenting the dataset in a real-world DL project. Thus, learning how to expand the dataset without purchasing new data is essential.This book covers standard and advanced techniques for extending the image, text, audio, and tabular dataset. Furthermore, there is a discussion on data biases, and the coding lessons are on Jupyter Python Notebooks.  \n",
        "\n",
        "Chapter 1 introduces the data augmentation concepts, sets up the coding environment, creates the foundation class, and later chapters explain techniques in detail, including Python coding. The effective use of data augmentation is the proven technique between success and failure in Machine Learning (ML). Many real-world ML projects stay in the conceptual phase because of insufficient data for training the ML model. Data augmentation is a cost-effective technique to increase the dataset, lower the training error rate, and produce a more accurate prediction and forecast.\n",

        ">**Fun fact**\n",
        "\n",
        ">The car gasoline analogy is helpful for students who first learn about data augmentation and AI. You can think of data for the AI engine as the gasoline and data augmentation as the additive, like the Chevron Techron fuel cleaner, that makes your car engine run faster, smoother, and further without extra petrol.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "In Chapter 1, we’ll define the data augmentation role and the limitation of how much to extend the data without changing the data integrity. We’ll briefly discuss the different types of input data, such as image, text, audio, and tabular data, and the challenges in supplementing the data. Finally, we’ll set up the system requirements and the programming style in the accompanying Jupyter Python Notebook.   \n",
        "\n",
        "I design this book to be a hands-on journey. It will be more effective to read a chapter, run the code, re-read the chapter’s part that confused you, and jump back to hacking the code until the concept or technique is firmly understood.    \n",
        "\n",
        "You are encouraged to change or add new code to the Python Notebooks. The primary purpose is interactive learning. Thus, if something goes horribly wrong, download a fresh copy from the book GitHub. The surest method to learn is to make mistakes and create something new.\n",
        "\n",
        "Data augmentating is an iterative process. There is no fixed recipe. In other words, depending on the dataset, you select augmented functions and jiggle the parameters. A subject domain expert may provide insight into how much distortion is acceptable. By the end of Chapter 1, you will learn the general rules for data augmentation, what type of input data can be augmented, the programming style, and how to set up a Python Jupyter Notebook online or offline.\n",
